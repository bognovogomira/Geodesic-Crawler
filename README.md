# Geodesic-Crawler
A genetic algorithm to search for geodesics in a Reimannian metric

A simulation of a 'creature' living in the Poincare model of the hyperbolic plane, trying to reach from one circle to the next. The fitness score depends on how close manages to get, and the fittest attempts get to breed. Combined with mutation, it explores enough paths to eventually arrive at close approximations to theoretically predicted geodesics, which are circular arcs.

Changing the metric and step size can be used to simulate and experimentally find geodesics in other kinds of spaces. The horizontal line represents infinity in the hyperbolic case. 

To run the simulation, make sure you have System.Random and Gloss packages.
